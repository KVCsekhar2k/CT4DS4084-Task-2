 Simple Linear Regression Project

 Overview
This repository contains a project focused on implementing a simple linear regression model using a dataset with continuous target variables. The project includes data splitting, model training, performance evaluation, and prediction. Additionally, the regression line and the actual vs. predicted values are visualized to assess the model's accuracy.

 Objectives
- Implement a simple linear regression model.
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Train the model on the training data.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²).
- Make predictions on the test set.
- Visualize the regression line and the actual vs. predicted values.

 Key Steps
1. Data Preparation:
   - Load and explore the dataset.
   - Preprocess the data, handling any missing values or outliers.

2. Data Splitting:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

3. Model Training:
   - Implement the simple linear regression model.
   - Train the model on the training data.

4. Performance Evaluation:
   - Evaluate the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) metrics.

5. Prediction:
   - Make predictions on the test set.
   - Visualize the regression line and the actual vs. predicted values.

 Tools and Technologies Used
- Python: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook: For interactive data analysis, model training, and visualization
- Git: For version control and collaboration

 Results
The simple linear regression model was successfully implemented and evaluated. The performance metrics and visualizations provided insights into the model's accuracy and effectiveness.

 Metrics:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE): [Include MSE value]
- R-squared (R²): [Include R² value]

 Visualizations:
1. Regression Line:
   - A plot showing the regression line fitted to the training data.
2. Actual vs. Predicted Values:
   - A scatter plot comparing the actual target values and the predicted values on the test set.

 Repository Structure
